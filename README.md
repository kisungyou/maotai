<!-- badges: end -->

**maotai** is an R package whose name is an acronym for **M**atrix
**A**lgebra, **O**p**T**imization, **A**nd **I**nference problems -
though I can’t deny motivation from one of [my father’s
favorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maotai) for the namesake. More
detailed introduction will be added later.
